# Hypothesis tests summarize information in research designs to help people reason about treatment effects

When researchers report that "The estimated average treatment effect is 5
($p=.02$)," they are using a shorthand to say, "Dear reader, in case you were
wondering whether we could distinguish signal from noise in the this
experiment using averages, in fact, we can. The experimental results are **not
consistent** with the idea that the treatment had no effects." People do
hypothesis tests in observational studies as well as in randomized
experiments. This guide focuses on their use in randomized experiments or
research designs that try to organize data so that they look
"as-if-randomized" (such as regression discontinuity designs or other natural or
quasi-experimental designs).

The $p$-value summarizes the ability of a given test to
distinguish signal from noise. As we saw in [10 Things You Need to Know about
Statistical Power](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-statistical-power),
whether an experiment can detect a treatment effect depends not
only on the size of the experimental pool, but also the distribution of the
outcome^[Outcomes with big outliers add noise, outcomes that are mostly 0 have
little signal, blocking or pre-stratification or covariance adjustment can
reduce noise.], the distribution of the treatment, and the substantive strength
of the intervention itself. When a researcher calculates a $p$-value as the
result of a hypothesis test, she is summarizing all of these aspects of a
research design as they bear on a particular claim---usually a claim that
the treatment had no causal effect.

The rest of this guide explains the pieces of a hypothesis test piece by piece:
from null hypothesis (the claim that the treatment had no causal effect), to
test-statistic summarizing the observed data (like a difference of means), to
the creation of a probability distribution that allows calculation of a
$p$-value. It also discusses the idea of rejecting (but not accepting) a
hypothesis and touches on the question of what makes for a good hypothesis
test (hint: an ideal hypothesis test should cast doubt on the truth rarely and
distinguish even faint signals from noise). See also [10 Things You Need to Know about Randomization Inference](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-randomization-inference) for more discussion of these ideas.

# In an experiment, a hypothesis is a claim about unobserved causal relationships

We do experiments to make interpretable causal comparisons
[@kinder1993behalf], and we often estimate average causal effects. What does
hypothesis testing have to do with causal inference? In this section we
explain a bit about the distinction between assessing claims about causal
effects versus making best guesses about causal effects.

## A quick overview of the fundamental problem of causal inference and an introduction to some notation

Recall from [Ten Things to Know about Causal Inference](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-causal-inference) that the counterfactual conceptualization of causality uses the idea of potential
outcomes to **define** cause and to formalize what we **mean** when we
say "X causes Y" or "Smoking causes cancer" or "Information increases tax
compliance."  Although there are other ways to think about causality
(@brady2008causation), the counterfactual idea suggests that we imagine that
each person, $i$, would pay their taxes, $y_{i}$,  if given
information about the use to which those taxes are put. Write $Z_i=1$ to mean
that information was giving to the person and $Z_i=0$ if no information was
given so that we can write $y_{i,Z_i=1}$ to refer to the amount of taxes paid
by someone given information and $y_{i,Z_i=0}$ to refer to the amount of taxes
paid by someone not given any information in particular. In an actual
experiment, we might [randomize the provision of information to citizens](https://egap.org/our-work-0/the-metaketa-initiative/roundtwo-taxation/), so some people will have the information and others
will not. We observe the taxes paid by people in both conditions but, for any
one person, we can only observe the taxes that they pay in one of the two
conditions. What does it **mean** when we say "causal effect"? It often means
that the outcome in one condition ($y_{i,Z_i=1}$ written slightly more simply
as $y_{i,1}$) and the outcome in the other condition ($y_{i,Z_i=0}$ or
$y_{i,0}$) *differ* for a given person, such that we would write $y_{i,Z_i=1}
\ne y_{i,Z_i=0}$.

We cannot observe *both* $y_{i,1}$ and $y_{i,0}$ for each person --- if we
gave information about taxes to a person we observe $y_{i,1}$ and so we
cannot observe how they would have acted if they had not been given this
information ($y_{i,0}$). So, we cannot use direct observation to learn about
this counterfactual causal effect and we can only **infer** about it.
@holland1986statistics calls this inability to use direct observation to
learn about counterfactual causality the "fundamental problem of causal
inference."


## An overview of estimation based approaches to causal inference in randomized experiments.

There are three main ways that the statistical sciences have engaged with the fundamental
problem of causal inference. All of these ways involve changing the target of inference. That is, when asked, "Does information cause people to pay their
taxes?" we tend to say, "We cannot answer that question directly. However, we can
answer a related question."

The first approach changes the question from whether information causes a particular person to pay her taxes to whether information causes people to pay their taxes *on average*. [Ten Types of Treatment Effect You Should Know About](https://egap.org/resource/10-types-of-treatment-effect-you-should-know-about/) describes how a scientist can **estimate average causal effects** in a randomized experiment even though individual causal effects are unobservable. This insight is credited to Jerzy Neyman. Judea
Pearl's work on estimating the conditional probability distribution of an outcome based on a causal model of that outcome is similar to this idea. Both approaches address the
fundamental problem of causal inference by changing the question to focus on averages
or conditional probabilities rather than individuals.

A related approach that is due to Don Rubin involves **predicting** the
individual level potential outcomes. The predictions are based on a
probability model of treatment assignment $Z_i$ (for example, $Z \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi)$) and a
probability model of the two potential outcomes (for example,
$(y_{i,1},y_{i,0}) \sim \text{Multivariate Normal}(\bbeta \bX, \bSigma)$ with a vector of coefficients $\bbeta$, an $n \times p$ matrix of variables $\bX$ (containing both treatment assignment and other background information) and a $p \times p$ variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$ describing how all of the columns in $\bX$ relate to one another). The probability models relate treatment, background information, and outcomes to one another. The approach combines these models with data using Bayes' Rule to produce posterior distributions for
quantities like the individual level treatment effects or average treatment
effects (see [@imbens2007causal] for more on what they call the Bayesian
Predictive approach to causal inference). So, this predictive approach focuses not on averages but on differences in predicted potential
outcomes for each person (although mostly these individual predicted differences are summarized using characteristics of the posterior distributions, like the average of the predictions.)

## Hypothesis testing is a statistical approach to the fundamental problem of causal inference using claims about the unobserved.

The third approach to this problem changes the question again.
@fisher:1935[Chapter 2] taught us that we can ask the fundamental question
about whether there is a causal effect for a single person, but the answer can
only be in terms of how much information the research design and data provide
about the question. That is, one can hypothesize that, for person $i$, the
information made no difference to their outcomes, such that $y_{i,1}=y_{i,0}$
or $y_{i,1}=y_{i,0}+\tau_i$ where $\tau_i=0$ for everyone. However, the answer to this
question has to be something like "This research design and dataset provide a
lot of information about this model or idea or hypothesis." or, as above,
"This research design is not consistent with that claim." (See
@rosenbaum2002(Chapter 2), @rosenbaum2010(chapter 2), and
@rosenbaum2017observation, for more details about this approach.)

# The Null Hypothesis of No Effects is a precise statement about potential outcomes

Even if we cannot use direct observation to learn about counterfactual causal
effects, we can still ask questions about them, or make theoretical models
that relate some intervention or treatment, background characteristics, and
potential outcomes. The simplest such model states that the outcome under
treatment would be the same as the outcome under control for all units; that
is, it would say that regardless of background characteristics, or information
given in the experimental treatment condition, each person would pay the same
amount in taxes: $y_{i,1}=y_{i,0}$ for all units $i$. To emphasize the
tentative and theoretical nature of this model, people have called this a
**hypothesis**, often write it as "the sharp null hypothesis."  and use the following shorthand: $H_0:
y_{i,1}-y{i,0}=\tau_i$ where $\tau_i=0$ for all units $i$.

**Side Note:** Notice that thinking about sharp hypotheses makes us realize
that we could make **other models relating $y_{i,1}$ and $y_{i,0}$** in which
the potential outcomes relate in ways that are not additive or linear, and
where the effect need not be zero or even the same for all units: for example,
we could hypothesize that $\tau_i=\{5,0,-2\}$ 5 for unit 1, 0 for unit 2, and
-2 for unit 3 in a 3 unit experiment. Notice also that writing potential
outcomes this way, with the potential outcome for unit $i$ *only referring to
$i$* and not some other units ($y_{i,Z_i}$), *is part of the model*. That is,
the particular model of $H_0: y_{i,1}=y_{i,0}$ implies that the treatment has
no effect on anyone --- and no effects includes no spillover effects. We could
be a little more specific by writing the potential outcomes like so: The
potential outcome of unit $i$ when it is assigned to treatment, and when all
of the other units are assigned to any other set of treatments
$\bZ_{~i}=\{Z_j,Z_k,\ldots \}$ can be written  $y_{i,Z_i=1,\bZ_{~i}}$. See
@bowers2013reasoning and @bowers2018models for more on the idea that
a hypothesis is a theoretical model that can be tested with data in the
context of hypotheses about the propagation of treatment effects across
a network.


# The weak null hypothesis of no effects is a statement about aggregated potential outcomes

An experiment may influence some units but, on average, have no effects.
To codify this intuition, researchers can write a null hypothesis
about an *average* of potential outcomes, or some other aggregated summary of
the potential outcomes, rather than about the whole
collection of potential outcomes.

Because most current discussions about causal effects talks about the
*average* of the effects, people write the weak null something like $H_0:
\bar{\tau}=0$ where $\bar{\tau}=(1/N)\sum_{i=1}^N \tau_i$. Again, the
hypothesis is a statement or model of a relationship among only partially
observed potential outcomes. But, here it is about the average of them. One
could, in principle, articulate hypotheses about other aggregates: medians,
percentiles, ratios, trimmed means, etc. However hypothesizing about average
effects simplifies the math and statistics: we know the properties of averages
of independent observations as sample sizes increase, so that we can appeal to
a Central Limit Theorem to describe the distribution of averages in large
samples---and this, in turn, makes calculating $p$-values quick and easy in
large samples.

# Randomization allows us to use what we observe to test hypotheses about what we do not observe.

Whether one hypothesizes about unit-level effects directly or about averages
of them, we still must confront the problem of distinguishing signal from noise. A hypothesis only refers to potential outcomes. Above,
assuming no interaction between units, we imagined two potential outcomes per
person, but we only observe one per person. **How can we use what we observe to
learn about theoretical models of partially observed quantities?** In this
simple experiment, we know that we observe one of the two potential outcomes
per person, depending on which treatment was assigned to that person. So, we
can link the unobserved counterfactual outcomes to an observed outcome ($Y_i$)
using treatment assignment ($Z_i$) like so:

\begin{equation}
Y_i = Z_i y_{i,1} + (1 - Z_i) y_{i,0}
\end{equation}

The above equation says that our observed outcome, $Y_i$ (here, amount of
taxes paid by person $i$), is $y_{i,1}$ when the person is assigned to the
treatment group ($Z_i=1$), and $y_{i,0}$ when the person is assigned to the
control group.

**How much information does our research design and dataset contain about the
hypothesis?** Imagine, for now, the hypothesis that treatment adds 5 to the tax
payments of every single person such that  $H_0: y_{i,1} = y_{i,0} + \tau_i$ where
$\tau_i=5$ for all $i$.

Let us entertain this model for the sake of argument. What would this
hypothesis imply for what we observe? The above equation relates observed
to unobserved so, this model or hypothesis would imply that:

$$ \begin{aligned}  Y_i & = Z_i ( y_{i,0} + \tau_i ) + ( 1 - Z_i) y_{i,0} \\
& = Z_i  y_{i,0} + Z_i \tau_i + y_{i,0} - Z_i y_{i,0} \\
& = Z_i \tau_i  + y_{i,0}
\end{aligned}
$$

What we observe, $Y_i$, would be either $y_{i,0}$ in the control condition,
$Z_i=0$ or $\tau_i + y_{i,0}$ (which would be $5 + y_{i,0}$ in the treatment
condition).

This hypothesis further implies that $y_{i,0} = Y_i - Z_i \tau_i$ or $y_{i,0}
= Y_i - Z_i 5$. If we subtracted  5 from each observed response in the
treatment condition, then our hypothesis implies that we would observe
$y_{i,0}$ for everyone. That is, by subtracting  5, we would make the
control and the treatment group equivalent in observed outcomes. **This logic gives us an
observable implication of the hypothesis.**

**The sharp null hypothesis of no effects** specifies that $\tau_i=0$ for all
$i$. And this in turn implies that $y_{i,0} = Y_i - Z_i \tau_i = Y_i$. That
is, it implies that what we observe, $Y_i$, is what we would observe if every
unit were assigned to the control condition. And the implication then, is that
we should see no differences between the treated and control groups in their
observable outcomes.

**The weak null hypothesis of no effects** specifies that
$\bar{\tau}=\bar{y}_{1} - \bar{y}_0 = 0$, and
we can write a similar identity linking means of unobserved potential outcomes to means
of observed outcomes in different treatment conditions.

# Test statistics summarize the relationship between observed outcomes and treatment assignment.

Given a hypothesis and a mapping from unobserved to observed outcomes, the
next ingredient in a hypothesis test is a test statistic. A test statistic
summarizes the relationship between treatment and observed outcomes using a
single number. In general, we would like our test statistics to take on larger
values the larger the treatment effect. The code below, for example, shows are two such test
statistics using an example experiment with 10 units randomized into two
groups (you can press the "CODE" button to see the R code).

```{r setupdata, results='hide', echo=TRUE}
## First, create some data,
##  y0 is potential outcome to control
N <- 10
y0 <- c(0,0,0,0,1,1,4,5,400,500)
## Different individual level treatment effects
##tau <- c(1,3,2,10,1,2,3,5,1,1)*sd(y0)
set.seed(12345)
tau <- round(rnorm(N,mean=sd(y0),sd=2*(sd(y0)))) ##c(10,30,200,90,10,20,30,40,90,20)
tau <- tau*(tau>0)
## y1 is potential outcome to treatment
y1 <- y0 + tau
#sd(y0)
#mean(y1)-mean(y0)
# mean(tau)
## Z is treatment assignment
set.seed(12345)
Z <- complete_ra(N)
## Y is observed outcomes
Y <- Z*y1 + (1-Z)*y0
## The data
dat <- data.frame(Y=Y,Z=Z,y0=y0,tau=tau,y1=y1)
#(mean(y1) - mean(y0))/sd(y0)
#dat
#pvalue(oneway_test(Y~factor(Z),data=dat,distribution=exact(),alternative="less"))
#pvalue(wilcox_test(Y~factor(Z),data=dat,distribution=exact(),alternative="less"))
#pvalue(oneway_test(Y~factor(Z),data=dat,distribution=exact(),alternative="greater"))
#pvalue(wilcox_test(Y~factor(Z),data=dat,distribution=exact(),alternative="greater"))
## The mean difference test statistic
meanTZ <- function(ys,z){
	mean(ys[z==1]) - mean(ys[z==0])
}

## The difference of mean ranks test statistic
meanrankTZ <- function(ys,z){
	ranky <- rank(ys)
	mean(ranky[z==1]) - mean(ranky[z==0])
}

observedMeanTZ <- meanTZ(ys=Y,z=Z)
observedMeanRankTZ <- meanrankTZ(ys=Y,z=Z)
```

The first test statistic is the mean difference (`meanTZ`) and returns an
observed value of `r observedMeanTZ` and the
second is the mean difference of the rank-transformed outcomes (`meanrankTZ`),
which returns a value of `r signif(observedMeanRankTZ,2)`.
One could also use versions of these test statistics standardized by their estimated
standard error (see @chung2013exact for an argument in favor of this test
statistic). To test the sharp null hypothesis of no effects, one may choose almost any test statistic such that the values of that function increase as the difference between treated and control outcomes increase (see @rosenbaum:2002, Chapter 2, for a discussion of "effect increasing" test statistics).

Test of the weak null of no effects use the differences of means (perhaps standardized or studentized) as the test statistic.


# $p$-values encode how much information a research design and test statistic tell us about the hypothesis. Hypothesis tests require distributions of the test statistic under the hypothesis.

Given a claim about the possible results of the experiment (i.e. an hypothesis) and
a way to summarize the observed data as it bears on the hypothesis (i.e. a test
statistic that should get bigger as the results diverge from the hypothesis
as explained above), we now want to move beyond description of the observed
data to learn how much natural variability we would expect to see in the
test statistic given the research design entertaining the hypothesis (to get us back to the question of
signal and noise).

How much evidence we have about a hypothesis depends on the design of the
study. A large experiment, for example, should have more information about
a hypothesis than a small one. So, what do we mean by evidence against the
hypothesis? How would we formalize or summarize this evidence so that larger
experiments tend to reveal more and small experiments tend to reveal less
information?

One answer to this question is to refer to the thought experiment of repeating
the study. Imagine, for the sake of argument, that the hypothesis was correct.
If we repeated the study and calculated the test statistic we would receive a
number --- this number would reflect the outcome of the experiment *under the
hypothesis*. Now, imagine repeating the hypothetical experiment many times,
recalculating the test statistic each time. The distribution of the test
statistics would then tell us all of the test statistics that could have occurred
if the null hypothesis were true. If the test statistic is a sum or mean,
then in a large experiment, we know that the distribution of those numbers
will be more closely concentrated around the focal hypothesized value (say,
$t(Z,y_0)$) than in a small experiment.

When we compare what we actually observe, $t(z,Y)$, to the distribution of
what we could have observed under the null, we learn that our given study is
typical or not typical of the null hypothesis. And we encode this typicality
or extremity with a $p$-value.

Notice that the $p$-value does not tell us about the probability associated
with the observed data. The observed data is observed. The probability arises
from the hypothetical, but possible, repetition of the experiment itself, the
test statistic, and the hypothesis. The one-tailed $p$-value is the probability
of seeing a value of our test statistic as great or greater than we actually
observed considering, for the sake of argument, a given hypothesis.

## An example: Testing the Sharp Null Hypothesis of No Effects

Let us test the sharp null hypothesis of no effects. In the case of the
example experiment, the treatment was assigned to exactly 5 observations out
of 10 completely at random. To repeat that operation, we need only permute or
shuffle the given $Z$ vector (you can see the Code by clicking on the "Code" button).

```{r}
repeatExperiment <- function(Z){
	sample(Z)
}
```

We already know that $H_0: y_{i,1} = y_{i,0}$ implies that $Y_i=y_{i,0}$. So,
we can describe all of the ways that the experiment would work out under this
null by simply repeating the experiment (i.e. re-assigning treatment) and
recalculating a test statistic each time. The following code repeatedly
re-assigns treatment following the design and calculates the test statistic
each time.

```{r gendists, cache=FALSE}
set.seed(123457)
possibleMeanDiffsH0 <- replicate(10000,meanTZ(ys=Y,z=repeatExperiment(Z=Z)))
set.seed(123457)
possibleMeanRankDiffsH0 <- replicate(10000,meanrankTZ(ys=Y,z=repeatExperiment(Z=Z)))
```

And these plots show the distributions of the two different test statistics
that would emerge from the world of the null hypothesis (the curves and short
ticks at the bottom of the plots). The plots also show the observed values for
the test statistics that we can use to compare what we observe (the long thick
lines) with what we hypothesize (the distributions).


```{r calcpvalues, results='hide'}
pMeanTZ <- min( mean( possibleMeanDiffsH0 >= observedMeanTZ ),
	       mean( possibleMeanDiffsH0 >= observedMeanTZ ))

pMeanRankTZ <- min( mean( possibleMeanRankDiffsH0 >= observedMeanRankTZ ),
		    mean( possibleMeanRankDiffsH0 <= observedMeanRankTZ ))
pMeanTZ
pMeanRankTZ
```


```{r fig.cap="An example of using the design of the experiment to test a hypothesis."}
par(mfrow=c(1,2),mgp=c(1.5,.5,0),mar=c(3,3,0,0),oma=c(0,0,3,0))
plot(density(possibleMeanDiffsH0),
     ylim=c(0,.04),
     xlim=range(possibleMeanDiffsH0),
     lwd=2,
     main="",#Mean Difference Test Statistic",
     xlab="Mean Differences Consistent with H0",cex.lab=0.75)
rug(possibleMeanDiffsH0)
rug(observedMeanTZ,lwd=3,ticksize = .51)
text(observedMeanTZ+8,.022,"Observed Test Statistic")

plot(density(possibleMeanRankDiffsH0),lwd=2,
     ylim=c(0,.45),
     xlim=c(-10,10), #range(possibleMeanDiffsH0),
     main="", #Mean Difference of Ranks Test Statistic",
     xlab="Mean Difference of Ranks Consistent with H0",cex.lab=0.75)
rug(possibleMeanRankDiffsH0)
rug(observedMeanRankTZ,lwd=3,ticksize = .9)
text(observedMeanRankTZ,.45,"Observed Test Statistic")

mtext(side=3,outer=TRUE,text=expression(paste("Distributions of Test Statistics Consistent with the Design and ",H0: y[i1]==y[i0])))
```

To formalize the comparison between observed and hypothesized, we can
calculate a $p$-value, i.e., the proportion of the hypothetical experiments that yield test
statistics greater  than or equal to the observed experiment. In the left panel of the
figure we see that a wide range of
differences of means between treated and control groups are compatible with
the treatment having no effects (with the overall range between `r min(possibleMeanDiffsH0)` and `r max(possibleMeanDiffsH0)`).  The right panel shows
that transforming the outcomes to ranks before taking the difference of means
reduces the range of the test statistics --- after all the ranks themselves go
from 1 to 10 rather than from 1 to 280.

### One-sided $p$-values

One-sided $p$-values capture the probability that a test statistic is at least as big or bigger (upper $p$-value) or at least as smaller or smaller (lower $p$-value) than the observed test statistic. Here, the one-sided $p$-values are `r pMeanTZ` for the simple mean difference and `r signif(pMeanRankTZ,2)` for the mean difference of the rank-transformed outcomes. Each
test statistic casts a different amount of doubt, or quantifies a different
amount of surprise, about the same null hypothesis of no effects. The outcome
itself is so noisy that the mean
difference of the rank-transformed outcomes does a better job of picking up
the signal than the simple mean difference. These data were generated with treatment effects built in, so
the null hypothesis of no effects is false, but the information about the
effects is noisy --- the sample size is small, and the distribution of the
outcomes involves some strange outlying points and treatment effects
themselves vary greatly.

### Two-sided $p$-values

Say we did not know in advance whether our experiment would show a negative
effect or a positive effect. Then we might make two hypothesis tests --- one
calculating the one-sided upper $p$-value and the other calculating the
one-sided lower $p$-value. Now, if we did this we would be calculating two
$p$-values and, if we made a standard practice of this, we would run the risk
of misleading ourselves. After all, recall from the [10 things about multiple
comparisons](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-multiple-comparisons)
that even if there really is no effect, 100 independent and well operating
tests of the null of no effects will yield no more than 5 $p$-values less than
.05. One easy solution to the challenge of summarizing extremity of
a experiment in either direction rather than just focusing on greater-than or
less-than is to calculate a two-sided $p$-value. This, by the way, is the
standard $p$-value produced by most canned software such as `lm()` and
`t.test()` and `wilcox.test()` in R. The basic idea is to calculate both
$p$-values and then multiply the smaller $p$-value by 2. (The idea here is
that you are penalizing  yourself for making  two  tests -- see
@rosenbaum2010design, Chap 2 and @cox1977role for  more on the idea of
multiplying the smaller p-value by two.)

```{r twosidedp}
## Here I use <= and >= rather than < and > because of the discreteness of the
## randomization distribution with only 10 observations. See discussions of
## the "mid-p-value"
p2SidedMeanTZ <-     2*min( mean( possibleMeanDiffsH0 >= observedMeanTZ ),
			   mean( possibleMeanDiffsH0 <= observedMeanTZ ))

p2SidedMeanRankTZ <- 2*min( mean( possibleMeanRankDiffsH0 >= observedMeanRankTZ ),
mean( possibleMeanRankDiffsH0 <= observedMeanRankTZ ))

```

In this case the two-sided $p$-values are `r p2SidedMeanTZ` and `r p2SidedMeanRankTZ` for the simple mean differences and means differences of ranks respectively. We interpret them in terms of "extremity" --- we would only see an observed mean difference as far away from zero as the one manifest in our results roughly 18% of the time, for example.

**As a side note:** The test of the sharp null shown here can be done without
writing the code yourself. The code that you'll see here (by clicking the code
buttons) shows how  to use different R packages to  test hypotheses  using
randomization-based inference.

## An example: Testing the weak null of no average effects

The weak null hypothesis is a claim about aggregates, and is nearly always
stated in terms of averages: $H_0: \bar{y}_{1} = \bar{y}_{0}$ The test
statistic for this hypothesis nearly always is the difference of means (i.e.
`meanTZ()` above. The below code shows the use of least squares (`lm()` in R)
for the purpose of  calculating differences of means as a  test statistic for
hypotheses about average effects. Notice that the OLS-based $p$-values differ
from those  calculated by `t.test()`  and `difference_of_means()`. Recall that
the OLS statistical inference is justified by the assumption of independent
and identically distributed observations yet, in most experiments, the
treatment itself changes the variation in the treatment group (thereby
violating the identical-distribution/homoskedasticity assumption of OLS). This
is one of a few reasons why best practice in testing the  weak  null
hypothesis of  no average treatment effects uses tools other than  those
provided by simple canned OLS procedures.

```{r}
lm1 <- lm(Y~Z,data=dat)
lm1P <- summary(lm1)$coef["Z","Pr(>|t|)"]
ttestP1 <- t.test(Y~Z,data=dat)$p.value
library(estimatr)
ttestP2 <- difference_in_means(Y~Z,data=dat)
c(lmPvalue=lm1P,
ttestPvalue=ttestP1,
diffOfMeansPvalue=ttestP2$p.value)
```

This code produces  the same results without using least squares --- after
all, we are just calculating differences of means and the variances of those
means as they might vary across repeated experiments  in the same  pool of
experimental units.

```{r byhand}
varEstATE <- function(Y,Z){
	var(Y[Z==1])/sum(Z) + var(Y[Z==0])/sum(1-Z)
}
seEstATE <- sqrt(varEstATE(dat$Y,dat$Z))
obsTStat <- observedMeanTZ/seEstATE
c(observedTestStat=observedMeanTZ,stderror=seEstATE,tstat=obsTStat,
  pval=2*min(pt(obsTStat,df=8,lower.tail = TRUE),
	     pt(obsTStat,df=8,lower.tail = FALSE))
  )
```

Notice that these tests all assume that the distribution of the test statistic
across repeated experiments would be well characterized by a $t$-distribution.
The left-hand panel in the figure above shows the realized distribution of one
way for the weak null to be true (i.e. if the sharp null is true): there are
many ways for the weak null to be true --- some of which are compatible with
large positive effects on some units and large negative effects on other
units, others are compatible with other patterns of individual level effects.
In this particular small data set, engineered to have a very skewed outcome
distribution, however, none of those patterns will produce a reference
distribution that look like a Normal or $t$-curve if the mean difference is
used as a test statistic. We will return to this point later when we discuss
the characteristics of a good test --- one of which is a controlled false
positive rate.

# In simple hypothesis tests, we do not accept null hypotheses.

Sometimes people want to make a decision using the $p$-value. Remember that a
$p$-value uses a test statistic and the idea of repeating the experiment to
quantifies information from the research design about a hypothesis. It is the
design, test statistic function and hypothesis which generates a probability
distribution. And it is the actual data, design, and test statistic function
that creates a single observed value.

The $p$-value just tells us how extreme the observed result is from the
perspective of the hypothesis. Or, we can think of the $p$-value as encoding
the inconsistency between our observed data and the hypothesis. What if we
want to make a decision? It turns out that **we can make decisions using
a $p$-value if we are willing to accept a certain amount of error.** Say, for
example, we see a one-tailed $p=.01$: this would mean that in only 1 in 100
hypothetical experiments representing the null hypothesis would we see
a result as large or larger than our actual result. We might be tempted to
say, that our observed result is so strange that we want to act as if the null
were false. This would be ok---after all a $p$-value alone cannot control the
behavior of an adult human---but the human has to know that in 1/100 cases
where the null is true, we would still see this result on this same subject
pool with this same experimental design. That is, if we used a small $p$-value to reject the null, or
acted as if the null were false we could still be making
an error. These incorrect rejections are sometimes called false positive errors because the
null hypothesis is so often zero and the desired effect (say, in medical
trials) is so often coded as positive.

Say we were happy to make 1 false positive error or false rejection in every
20 experiments. In that case, we should also be happy to reject a null hypothesis if we saw a $p
\le 1/20$ or  $p \le .05$.  And we would call $p$-values smaller than .05 signals of
inconsistency with the null hypothesis and thus should only lead us to err in 5% of
experiments like the one that we are analyzing.

## What does it mean to reject a null hypothesis?

Notice that a $p=.01$ only reflects extremity of the observed data compared
with the hypothesis --- it means that the observed test statistic looks
extreme when considered from the perspective of the distribution of tests
statistics that are generated from the null hypothesis and research design.
So, we think of $p=.01$ (and other small $p$-values) as casting doubt on
whether the specific hypothesis is a good model of the observed data. Often
the only model of potential outcomes that is tested is the model of no
effects, so a small $p$-value should make us doubt the model of no effects.
The makers of canned regression software tend to print out a $p$-value that
refers to this hypothesis  automatically,  so that it is difficult to not see
the results of this test even if you just want to describe differences of
means in the data but you are using least squares as your difference of means
calculator.

## What does it mean to **not reject** a null hypothesis?

Notice that a $p=.50$ only reflects extremity of the observed data compared
with the hypothesis---but the observed data, in this case, do not look
extreme but common from the perspective of the null hypothesis. So, $p=.5$
(and other large p-values) do not encourage us to doubt the model of the null
hypothesis. It does not encourage us to accept that model---it is only a
model after all. We do not know how reasonable the model was a priori, for example.
So, a single large $p$-value is some argument in favor of the null,
but not a very clear argument.


# Once you are using $p$-values to reject a hypothesis, you will make errors

A good test rarely rejects true hypotheses (i.e. has a controlled false
positive error rate) and easily detects signal from noise (i.e. has good
statistical power, it rarely makes the error of missing the signal in the
noise).

## How to learn about errors of missing the signal in the noise?

The [10 Things you need to know about statistical
power](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-statistical-power)
guide explains how we want hypotheses to reject false nulls (i.e. detect
signal from noise). When we think about the power of statistical tests, we
need to consider the **alternative hypothesis**. However, as we have shown
above, we can test **null hypotheses** without the idea of rejecting or
accepting them although then the "power" of a test is harder to define and work with.

## How to learn about false positive errors?

The easiest way to learn about false positive errors is by simulation. First,
we create the situation where the null is true and known, and then we test
that null under the many ways that it is possible for that null to be true.
For example, in the example experiment used here, we have 5 units assigned to
treatment out of 10. This means that there are  $\binom{10}{5}=252$ different
ways to assign treatment --- and  252 ways for the experiment to have had no
effects on the individuals.

We demonstrate here setting the sharp or strict null hypothesis to be zero,
but one could also assess the false positive rate for different hypotheses. We
compare error rates for a few of the approaches used so far, including the
test of the weak null of no effects. The following plot shows the proportion
of $p$-values less than any given level of significance (i.e. rejection
threshold) for each of four tests. That is, this is a plot of false positive
rates for any given significance threshold. A test that has a controlled or
known false positive rate would have symbols on or below the line across the
whole x-axis or range of the plot. As we can see here, the two tests using
permutations of treatment to assess the sharp null of no effects have this feature. The tests of the
weak null using the mean difference test statistic and appealing to the large
sample theory to justify the use of a $t$-distribution do not have
a controlled false positive rate: the proportion of $p$-values below any given
rejection threshold can be too high or too low.

```{r}
collectPValues <- function(y,z){
	## Make Y and Z have no relationship by re-randomizing Z
	newz <- repeatExperiment(z)
        thelm <- lm(y~newz,data=dat)
	ttestP2 <- difference_in_means(y~newz,data=dat)
	owP <- pvalue(oneway_test(y~factor(newz),distribution=exact()))
	ranky <- rank(y)
	owRankP <- pvalue(oneway_test(ranky~factor(newz),distribution=exact()))
	return(c(lmp=summary(thelm)$coef["newz","Pr(>|t|)"]
,
		 neyp=ttestP2$p.value[[1]],
		 rtp=owP,
		 rtpRank=owRankP))
}
```

```{r fprdsim, cache=TRUE, results='hide'}
set.seed(12345)
pDist <- replicate(5000,collectPValues(y=dat$Y,z=dat$Z))
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1),mgp=c(1.25,.5,0),oma=rep(0,4),mar=c(3,3,0,0))
plot(c(0,1),c(0,1),type="n",
     xlab="p-value=p",ylab="Proportion p-values < p")
for(i in 1:nrow(pDist)){
	lines(ecdf(pDist[i,]),pch=i,col=i)
}
abline(0,1,col="gray")
legend("topleft",legend=c("OLS","Neyman","Rand Inf Mean Diff","Rand Inf Mean \n Diff Ranks"),
			  pch=1:5,col=1:5,lty=1,bty="n")
```

In this particular case, at the threshold of $\alpha=.05$, all of the tests
except for the rank based test report less than a 5% false positive rate --
this is good, it should be 5% or less. However, this is no  guarantee  of good
performance by the large-sample based tests in other small experiments, or
experiments with highly skewed  outcomes,  etc... When in doubt it is  easy to
assess the false positive rate  of a test by using the code in this guide to
make your own simulation.

```{r fpr05}
apply(pDist,1,function(x){ mean(x<.05)})
```

# What else to know about hypothesis tests.

Here we list a few other important but advanced topics connected to hypothesis
testing:

 - Even if a given testing procedure controls the false positive rate for
   a single test, it may not control the rate for a group of multiple tests.
   See [10 Things you need to know about multiple
   comparisons](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-multiple-comparisons)
   for a guide to the approaches to controlling such rejection-rates in
   multiple tests.
 - A $100\alpha$\% confidence interval can be defined as the range of
   hypotheses where all of the $p$-values are greater than or equal to
   $\alpha$. This is called inverting the hypothesis test.
   (@rosenbaum2010design). That is, a **confidence interval is a collection of
   hypothesis tests**. This  means that criticisms of $p$-values are also
   criticisms of confidence intervals.
 - A point estimate based on hypothesis testing is called a Hodges-Lehmann
   point estimate. (@rosenbaum1993hlp,@hodges1963elb)
 - A set of hypothesis tests can be combined into one single hypothesis test.
   For example, you can test the hypothesis of an effect of  size 1 on
   outcome 1, an effect  of size 0  on outcome 2 and an effect of -10 on
   outcome 3. (@hansen:bowers:2008,@caughey2017nonparametric)
 - In equivalence testing, one can hypothesize that two test-statistics are
   equivalent (i.e. the treatment group is the same as the control group)
   rather than only about one test-statistic (the difference between the two
   groups is zero) {@hartman2018equivalence}
 - Since a hypothesis test is a model of potential outcomes, one can use
   hypothesis testing to learn about complex models, such as models of
   spillover and propagation of treatment effects across networks
   (@bowers2013reasoning, @bowers2016research, @bowers2018models)
